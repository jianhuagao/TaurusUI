## ✨ What is TaurusUI?

TaurusUI is a curated collection of modern, production-ready UI components built with **Tailwind CSS**.

No installation.  
No framework lock-in.  
No runtime dependencies.

Just find what you need → copy the code → paste into your project.

Perfect for developers who want:

- Fast prototyping
- Clean Tailwind examples
- Copy-paste production components
- No UI framework overhead
- Full design control

---

## 🚀 How to Use

Using TaurusUI is intentionally simple:

1. Open the website
2. Browse or search for a component
3. Copy the code
4. Paste into your project
5. Customize as needed

> As long as your project uses Tailwind CSS, components should work immediately.

- 🧱 Copy-paste friendly
- 🎨 Fully customizable

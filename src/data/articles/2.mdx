Contributing to TaurusUI

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **TaurusUI** ❤️
TaurusUI is a free open-source Tailwind CSS component library, and contributions that improve quality, consistency, and documentation help the project become easier to adopt and more likely to be recommended by official communities.

> If you’re unsure what to work on, start with: documentation fixes, accessibility improvements, missing examples, or polishing existing components.

## 1) Before You Start: Open an Issue

Please **open an Issue first** for:

- New components / new component categories
- Behavior changes / refactors
- Any change that might affect existing pages

This helps us align on scope and avoid wasted work. (Small typos can skip the issue step.)

---

## 2) Local Setup

TaurusUI is a Next.js project and uses Tailwind CSS CLI to build a generated CSS file.

### Requirements

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm / pnpm (repo includes pnpm lockfile)

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jianhuagao/TaurusUI.git
cd TaurusUI
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:

- `npm run dev` runs `predev` which builds CSS first.
- You can rebuild styles manually with:

Bashnpm run css

## 3) Project Structure (What matters for contributors)

### Components catalog (MDX)

TaurusUI’s component pages are sourced from:

- `src/data/components/<CategoryFolder>/<ComponentName>.mdx`

The app reads categories by scanning `src/data/components` directories and **removes a leading `number.` prefix** from folder names for display (so folders like `01.Buttons` are OK).
Each MDX file is loaded and parsed using `next-mdx-remote/serialize` with `parseFrontmatter: true`.

> ✅ This means:
>
> - Categories are folders under `src/data/components`
> - Each component page is an `.mdx` file
> - Frontmatter is important (metadata is used by the UI)

---

## 4) Adding or Improving a Component

### A) Choose the right category folder

Add your MDX file under an existing category folder in `src/data/components`.

If you create a new category folder:

- Use a consistent name
- Prefer the existing numbering style (e.g. `03.Cards`) so it’s naturally ordered
- Keep category names short and clear

### B) Create / Edit the MDX file

Create a new file:

- `src/data/components/<CategoryFolder>/<ComponentName>.mdx`

#### Frontmatter guidelines

TaurusUI reads metadata from the MDX frontmatter and expects component pages to be consistent.

Keep frontmatter:

- **Stable** (don’t rename keys casually)
- **Complete** (title/id/slug-like fields should be present)
- **Documented** (if you add a new key, explain it in the PR)

If you’re not sure what keys to include, check existing MDX files in the same folder and copy the pattern.

### C) Tailwind-only (keep it portable)

To make TaurusUI components “copy/paste ready”:

- Use **Tailwind CSS utilities** for styling
- Avoid hidden dependencies on app-specific CSS unless it’s documented
- Avoid runtime-only logic unless the component is explicitly marked interactive

### D) Accessibility & UX expectations

We strongly prefer:

- Good contrast, readable spacing
- Proper semantic HTML
- Focus states for interactive elements
- `aria-*` attributes when needed
- No “hover-only” critical UI

Small accessibility improvements are very welcome.

## 5) CSS / Class Scanning Rules (important)

TaurusUI builds a single CSS output using Tailwind CLI and scans sources including:

- `public/components`
- `public/articleDemo`
- `public/playgroundDemo`
- `public/homeDemo`
- `src/data`

So when you add new demo markup or component snippets, place them in the appropriate directories so Tailwind can pick up the classes.

If you add new utility classes and they don’t appear, rebuild CSS:

Bashnpm run css

---

## 6) Pull Request Process

### PR expectations

- Keep PRs focused: one feature / fix per PR
- Add screenshots / short clips for UI changes
- Explain what changed, why, and how to verify
- If you change an API/metadata shape, document it clearly

### Review rules

All PRs are reviewed before merge. Feedback is normal—please address it.

If feedback from the first review isn’t addressed after multiple follow-ups, the PR may be closed to keep the queue healthy.
(If new feedback appears later, just handle it as usual.)

---

## 7) Coding Style & Formatting

- Follow the existing code style
- Keep TypeScript types strict where possible
- Run lint before pushing if you can:

Bashnpm run lint

---

## 8) Commit Message Convention (recommended)

Use a simple conventional style:

- `feat: ...` new component / feature
- `fix: ...` bug fix
- `docs: ...` documentation only
- `refactor: ...` refactor without behavior change
- `chore: ...` tooling, deps, non-product code

Example:

- `feat: add new pricing card component`
- `fix: improve dark mode contrast for buttons`

## 10) Thank You

Every contribution matters—typos, docs, examples, and accessibility improvements are all valuable.
Thank you for helping TaurusUI become a stronger, more polished library ❤️
